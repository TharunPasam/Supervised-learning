**Logistic Regression** : Logistic regression model will transform the linear regression function continuous value output into categorical value output using a sigmoid function.

We will use Logistic Regression for solving classification problems and we can predict values of categorical variables.

**Sigmoid Function** : Sigmoid is a mathematical function which will take any real number and it will map it to a probability between 0 and 1.

Formula for sigmoid function : f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x)).

With the help of Logistic Regression we will be analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.

**K nearest neighbour** :
Firstofall we will be selecting the number K of the neighbors.
Then we will calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors.
Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.
Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.
Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum and then our model will be ready.

**Steps to implement KNN** :
Data Pre-processing step
Fitting the K-NN algorithm to the Training set
Predicting the test result
Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)
Visualizing the test set result.
